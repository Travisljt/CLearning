For the extension.c, I just add some interesting thing to enhence the visual effects.

I have add A direction in struct roller

struct roller
{
    char arr[MAX][MAX];
    int row;
    int col;
    int flag;
    int parent;
    int direction; <-
};
typedef struct roller roller;

Each time it is judged that the board is not a duplicate, mark it as the result obtained by the parent board in one direction (up, down, left, and right)

Then through "more" command to print out more details
